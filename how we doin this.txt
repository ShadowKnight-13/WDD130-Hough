So, how are we going about this one? I don't think we've gotten a site plan, or any assignments about how we're dividing up the labor. I would like to know what you want us to be in charge of, so that I can start working on my share of the work. 
It'd be great to know.

As I said in the email I sent you, Jacob you will be working on page 2. On the site plan it is the page about intermurals and pickup games. You will be building the html for that page.

thank you so much for waiting until 2 days before the due date to grant me access to the site plan.
